![ByteWise](https://chthcs.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/bytewisewhite.png)

Recurrent neural network for identifying byte patterns in binaries with Python scripts for munging binaries obfuscated with [OLLVM](https://github.com/syreal17/obfuscator-annotating).

Documentation is pending for this project. For now, at a high level, the workflow for ByteWise is: 

1. Get Data 
2. Munge Data to Neural Network consumable form 
3. Cross Validate and Train Neural Networks
4. Test Neural Network
5. Analyze Results
